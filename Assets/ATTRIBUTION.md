# Asset attribution

## Session crabs: Clawd pets
`Assets/pets/src/*.svg` are animated SVGs from
[abderrahimghazali/clawd-pet](https://github.com/abderrahimghazali/clawd-pet) (MIT, © 2026 Abderrahim Ghazali),
also browsable at https://clawd-pet.vercel.app. `tools/render-pets.py` bakes them into the frame
sheets in `Assets/pets/*.png` (headless Chrome + the Web Animations API). The app icon is the
"happy" pet on a rounded square.

State → pet: working = coding · moving = crab-walking · tool = working-tool-calling ·
permission = praying · question = asking* · done = celebrating · done & seen = idle-living ·
dormant = sleeping · error = dizzy · leaving = going-away.

\* `clawd-asking.svg` is a derivative, not an upstream pet: the crab body reuses clawd-pet's
shape and palette so it matches the set, while the bouncing "!", the pulsing attention ring and
the hop/claw-wave were drawn for Clawdy. Same MIT terms as the rest.

## Sub-agent baby crabs: pixel crab
`Assets/crab-walk-strip.png` — 20-frame pixel-art crab walk cycle, 51×36 px per frame, extracted
from `Sources/CrabFrames.swift` in [m1ckc3s/claude-status-bar](https://github.com/m1ckc3s/claude-status-bar)
(MIT), which generated them from `Clawd-CrabWalking.gif`.
