# Builds the app and wraps it in a drag-to-Applications DMG: build/Clawdy-<version>.dmg
# The disk image opens as a window with the crab on the left, Applications on the
# right and an arrow in between (Assets/dmg/background.tiff, drawn by
# tools/make-dmg-background.py).
#
# The app is ad-hoc signed unless a "Developer ID Application" certificate is in your keychain.
# Ad-hoc builds run fine locally; other people must right-click > Open the first time.
# To ship without that warning you need an Apple Developer account, then:
#   1. codesign --force --options runtime --timestamp --sign "Developer ID Application: …" build/Clawdy.app
#   2. xcrun notarytool submit build/Clawdy-<version>.dmg --keychain-profile <profile> --wait
#   3. xcrun stapler staple build/Clawdy-<version>.dmg
